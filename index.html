            <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">When it came to podcasts the only kinda i would listen to was sport based ones. Well all that changed
               once the country had to shut down due to the pandemic. Sport podcasts became really stale and
               repetitive. I had to find something else keep my mind busy while i was act work. So one day
               went to Spotify and start searching for something new and thats when i discoverd the word of
               Dungeons and Dragons. Below I have listed my top 3 favorite D&amp;D podcasts to listen too.

                           <br>You have found yourself among those who roll the Dark Dice. These events happened long ago; 
                           <br>stories brought back from the edge of oblivion, dutifully transcribed, and enhanced aurally
                           <br> to better captivate your attention. I regret to inform you that this story follows a team of 
                           <br>flawed individuals; selfish, foolish, na√Øve, and ill suited for the path of a hero.  But not 
                           <br>every story is about heroes. Some tales are fables of warning. Do not go into the woods at night. 
                           <br>Fear the strangers in your midst. Never play games with fate.
